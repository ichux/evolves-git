Simulates how to do one man local automation of a github coding process

# how to use
1. add what you want to commit to the file `did-these.txt`
2. Ensure that on each job that you do, it's captured in it.
3. One sure way to help yourself is to use `git status`
4. Then, to deploy, run `source automate.sh` or `. automate.sh`

# very important
You may also decide not to commit the file `did-these.txt`.
Just add it to the `.gitignore` or add it to the`.git/info/exclude` file

But then, you must create the file, else, your command will fail.
